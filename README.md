# auto_pbs

The purpose of this repo is to simplify setup and submission
of Portable Batch System (PBS) jobs. The script is designed to best serve PBS
jobs that do calculations using [gaussian](http://gaussian.com/running/).

# Installing the Script

1. Login to the server used to submit PBS jobs.
2. Clone this repo using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/icolwell/auto_pbs.git
    ```

# Quickstart

Simply place gaussian input (.inp) files in the `auto_pbs/input/` directory and run the script using the following command.
```
bash auto_pbs/scripts/submit_jobs.bash
```
A test input file is included. Run this first to ensure everything is working properly.

Output, checkpoint and formatted checkpoint files will be generated in the appropriate directories. A log generated by the script will be available in the log directory if it is necessary to troubleshoot submission problems.

# Note about input files

Do not place `%Chk=` directives at the top of the input file. Checkpoint files are handled
automatically by the script.
