# autoGauss

This repo simplifies setup and submission of electronic structure calculations
using [Gaussian](http://gaussian.com/running/).

# Installing the Script

1. Login to the server used to submit jobs.
2. Clone this repo to your home directory using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/icolwell/auto_pbs.git
    ```

# Running the Script

Simply place Gaussian input (.inp) files in the `auto_pbs/input/` directory
and run the script using the following command.
```
bash auto_pbs/scripts/submit_jobs.bash
```
A test input file is included. Run this first to ensure everything is working
properly.

Output, checkpoint and formatted checkpoint files will be generated in the
appropriate directories. A log generated by the script will be available in
the `auto_pbs/logs/` directory.

## Note about input files

Do not place `%Chk=` directives at the top of the input file. Checkpoint files
are handled automatically by the script.
