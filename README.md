# auto_pbs

This repo simplifies setup and submission of Portable Batch System (PBS) jobs
that perform electronic structure calculations using [gaussian](http://gaussian.com/running/).

# Installing the Script

1. Login to the server used to submit PBS jobs.
2. Clone this repo to your home directory using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/icolwell/auto_pbs.git
    ```

# Running the Script

Simply place gaussian input (.inp) files in the `~/auto_pbs/input/` directory
and run the script using the following command. A test input file is included.
Run this first to ensure everything is working properly.
```
bash ~/auto_pbs/scripts/submit_jobs.bash
```
Output and checkpoint files will be generated in the appropriate directories.
A log generated by the script will be available in the `~/auto_pbs/logs/` directory.

## Note about input files

Do not place `%Chk=` directives at the top of the input file. Checkpoint files
are handled automatically by the script.
